        "Content": "As we’re now in the first quarter of 2022, experts have had the time to calculate the total revenues made by the “Big 4” Korean entertainment companies in the fourth quarter of 2021: HYBE Labels, SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment. Overall, their total revenue together came to an incredible 730.7 billion KRW (or ~607 million USD)! Here is how much each company made, from lowest to highest revenue, between October and December 2021. | BigHit Entertainment Out of the “Big 4” companies, the one that made the least revenue (but still an extremely impressive amount) for the last quarter of 2021 is JYP Entertainment.  The total amount that they made during this time was 58.4 billion KRW (~ 48.5 million USD). Stray Kids came out as the company’s biggest source of revenue in the year thanks to their million+ sales of NOEASY, but TWICE and ITZY both made large contributions as well! Going into 2022, the company’s new artists Xdinary Heroes and NMIXX, along with the debut team members of SBS’s audition program Loud, are expected to bring in high revenue. | JYP Entertainment Coming in third place for the highest revenue for the last quarter of last year is YG Entertainment!  The total amount that they made during this time was 77.2 billion KRW (~ 64.2 million USD). While this is less than the other two companies on this list, it’s still nothing to scoff at, especially considering that the only major releases that came out in the fourth quarter were from Mino and Kang Seungyoon. For 2022, it looks like YG Entertainment is already planning several big releases from TREASURE, BLACKPINK, and WINNER, along with a new girl group, and together they’ll certainly bring in the cash! | YG Entertainment The company to make the second-highest amount in revenue for the final quarter of 2021 is SM Entertainment.  The total amount that they made during this time was 192.7 billion KRW (~ 160.2 million USD). The company had a number of major comebacks in the last quarter, namely from NCT 127, aespa, Kai, and Super Junior D&E, all of which contributed to the 4+ million albums sold in that time. Moving into 2022, it sounds like SM Entertainment is planning to expand their ventures into new territory, including NFTs. | SM Entertainment And finally, the Korean entertainment company that made the highest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 is HYBE Labels!  The total amount that they made during this time was 402.4 billion KRW (~ 334.5 million USD). This was the highest-earning quarter of 2021 for the company, due mostly to album releases by SEVENTEEN and ENHYPEN (who sold around 4.77 million units). Thanks to this high number, HYBE Labels is likely going to reach the 1 trillion KRW milestone for total sales in 2021! The company’s plans for 2022 include BTS‘s Permission To Dance On Stage concert in Seoul, as well as the launch of Weverse 2.0 and a dive into the NFT market. ",

        "Content": "While JYP Entertainment‘s upcoming girl group is currently known as JYPn, that’s not actually the name they’ll debut with. Up until now, there’s been no sign of an official name reveal for the JYPn project—but it may have been leaked in a recent trademark application. JYPn is the project name for JYP Entertainment’s first new girl group since ITZY debuted around two and a half years ago. Currently, the group has four members revealed: 17-year-old Sullyoon, JYPn’s Sullyoon | @JYPn_official/Twitter 17-year-old Jinni, JYPn’s Jinni | @JYPn_official/Twitter 16-year-old Jiwoo, JYPn’s Jiwoo | @JYPn_official/Twitter and 15-year-old Kyujin. JYPn’s Kyujin (center) and Jinni (right) | @JYPn_official/Twitter According to press releases, the pre-debut name JYPn was chosen to represent multiple meanings: “next,” “now,” “new,” and “n” itself, which is typically used to represent an unknown number or factor. JYPn’s Jinni, Kyujin, and Jiwoo | JYPn/YouTube Since the group was announced, many name rumors have circulated among early fans. At first, it was believed that JYPn would officially be named SQU4D, indicating a possible four-member group. However, it was later revealed that SQU4D is the name of JYP Entertainment’s “Division 4,” the side of the company expected to manage the new girl group. Other speculated names included Neora (a combination of “neo,” meaning new, and “era”), Xdinary Heroes (a shortened version of “extraordinary heroes”), and Cherryz (a name which has been circulating since just months after ITZY’s debut). JYPn’s Sullyoon | JYPn/YouTube But now, a new trademark registration may have revealed the true name of JYP Entertainment’s new girl group. On September 13, the company applied for a new trademark under the name NMIXX. | KIPRIS At first glance, given the focus on the letter “N,” NMIXX definitely looks like it could be a possible name for JYPn. On top of that, it’s also very similar to 6MIX. 6MIX was the original name for the pre-debut JYP Entertainment group that preceded TWICE, consisting of Jihyo, Jeongyeon, Sana, and Nayeon along with two other trainees. First planned to debut around 2014 or 2015, the team was “disbanded” ahead of SIXTEEN and TWICE eventually took its place. (Left to right) TWICE’s Jihyo, Jeongyeon, Sana, and Nayeon | Mnet On top of the trademark, fans have also uncovered a Twitter account under the name @NMIXX_official, created in the same month as the official JYPn Twitter. However, Twitter allows users to change their names at any time, which means that it’s possible a fan claimed the username after the NMIXX trademark was revealed. well then …. NMIXX YOUR NEXT FAVORITE GIRL GROUP  both accounts were made in May 2021#JYPn #NMIXX pic.twitter.com/B1EkSbio5p — 🍒 (@jinnigenie) September 15, 2021  That aside, another possible clue could be JYPn’s current logo. JYPn’s logo | JYP Entertainment Look closely, and you’ll notice that all the letters in NMIXX can be seen in the formation. Your browser does not support video. Currently, the trademark is only registered under the categories for cosmetics and perfumes, digital media like CDs, and jewelry—classifications often used for trademarked merchandise. K-Pop group names are often usually registered under the classifications for business and entertainment too. However, it’s not uncommon for companies to apply for trademarks in these categories at a later date. It’s also interesting to note that trademark registrations were how ITZY’s name was first leaked to the public around four months before their debut. ITZY | JYP Entertainment All in all, while there’s no guarantee that NMIXX was trademarked for JYPn, it definitely seems like a believable fit. Meanwhile, fans are divided on the name itself. While some think NMIXX will fit the group well, others prefer the previously speculated names. That said, group names like ITZY—which are well-loved today—were originally met with mixed opinions too. With JYPn expected to debut in the first half of 2022, it may not be long until official name confirmation drops. ",
